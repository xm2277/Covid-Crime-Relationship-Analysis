Description about this project:

We performed a profound analysis over two datasets: 
- MRI: Digital Transaction Breakdown by Store Territory. 
- Social media data:  Obtained by data crawling on the hottest social media app—Instagram to get information about posting patterns and number of followers of each corresponding artists.

In this project we will discover and answer:
1.From the artist’s perspective, their main concern is what factors will influence their track selling units?  To solve this question, we can study whether there are casual effects between artists’ selling units and digital stores, releasing location(geographically), releasing date(seasonal) etc. Ideally, we will figure out the most popular digital store, and comparatively the most ideal releasing time and location for different artists.
2.From the investment firm’s perspective, its goal is to shuffle out the worthy and talented artists and continue investing in them. Again, based on the information from MRI dataset, we can analyze the selling units, net/gross profits to calculate different tracks’ total revenue for the firm. We might take other factors into consideration at the same time, such as the releasing location(geographically) and releasing time, to reduce the bias. However, our focus would be on the value brought by different artists. Furthermore, we will also refer to related information like followers’ number, number of posts likes from Instagram to consider the artist’s overall influence. 
  
3.The investment firm may also wish to quantify the value of different digital stores. 
They wish to make wise investment into different digital platforms. To solve this problem, we can study the casual effect among multiple variables, such as the total revenue, digital platform, releasing location and releasing time. In addition, some artists may have preference on some specific digital stores, we will also show it through our visualizing plots.
